                    "Ringworm is the common name given to a fungal infection of the skin, hair, and nails. Ringworm infections can occur in humans and in all domesticated species of animals. The name comes from the classical appearance of the round, red, raised 'ring' marking the boundary of inflammatory lesions in people infected with the disease. The common name of ringworm is somewhat misleading, in that it is not an infection caused by a worm, and the infected areas are not always ring-shaped.",
                    "How is ringworm transmitted?",
                    "The fungi responsible for ringworm infections belong to a specialized group known as dermatophytes, so the medical name for this disease is dermatophytosis. There are several distinct species of dermatophytes. Some species of dermatophytes are species-specific with infection, meaning that they will only infect one species, whereas others can be spread between different species of animals or from animals to humans."

The fungi involved are called dermatophytes, and the more scientifically correct name for ringworm is dermatophytosis. The dermatophyte fungi feed upon the dead cells of skin and hair, causing in people a classic round, red lesion with a ring of scale around the edges and normal recovering skin in the center. Because the ring of irritated, itchy skin looked like a worm, the infection was erroneously named.  The characteristic ring appearance is primarily a human phenomenon. In animals, ringworm frequently looks like a dry, grey, scaly patch but can also mimic any other skin lesion and have any appearance.",
                    "Where Would My Pet Pick Up This Infection?",
                    "The spores of dermatophyte fungi are extremely hardy in the environment; they can live for years. All it takes is skin contact with a spore to cause infection; however, the skin must be abraded, as the fungus cannot infect healthy, intact skin. This means that freshly shaved, scraped, or scratched skin is especially vulnerable."

                    "I am sorry you are dealing with ringworm. Rest assured there are some options to significantly decrease and even eliminate ringworm in foster homes. Apart from general cleanliness, environmental decontamination of ringworm is critical because it prevents fomite contamination and false positive test results of cats.",
                    "The first thing to keep in mind is that ringworm does NOT multiply in and throughout the home (like mold can), because ringworm spores require a host and keratin to survive. This also means that ringworm does NOT spontaneously move through the house, although it can be moved by fomites (mostly humans) or free-roaming fosters that are infected. Infected hairs tend to be damaged and these hairs are generally shed into the environment. Accordingly, treating the cats (I am making the assumption of cats, since we do not see ringworm in dogs as often) and properly cleaning the environment will get you on the right path. "
